# Spring Framework

&nbsp;  **Spring Framework** is an open source application framework which is leightweight has been designed by **Rod Johnson** and first version released in 2003.

&nbsp;  **The purpose of Spring Framework** is to enable easy, fast and reliable development of any robust and large-scale Java application. Additionally, it provides a bunch of different extensions that can be used to build all kinds of large-scale applications on Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition). Therefore, it is one of the most preferred frameworks in most enterprise Java applications.

&nbsp;  **The reason for the emergence of the Spring Framework** is that Java EE (new name Jakarta EE), which was widely used before the Spring Framework, has a very complex application development environment and a deep Java EE learning requirement due to this complexity. The fact that these requirements also increase the management cost of the applications has ensured that the Spring Framework has been kept in a short time against to Java EE.


### The brief reasons why the Spring Framework is so popular and used are;
 * It uses POJO(Plain Old Java Object), donâ€™t need an enterprise container like an application server.
 * It's is Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) features provide the foundation for a wide-ranging set of features and functionality.
 * It provides a great level of modularity.
 * Well-Designed Web Framework.
 * Spring application code tends to be very easy to make test cases for various testings.
 * Middle-tier objects can be easily organized.
