# What is Spring Framework?

Spring Framework is an open source application framework which is leightweight has been designed by **Rod Johnson** and first version released in 2003.

The purpose of Spring Framework is to enable easy, fast and reliable development of any robust and large-scale Java application. Additionally, it provides a bunch of different extensions that can be used to build all kinds of large-scale applications on Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition). Therefore, it is one of the most preferred frameworks in most enterprise Java applications.

The reason for the emergence of the Spring Framework is that Java EE (new name Jakarta EE), which was widely used before the Spring Framework, has a very complex application development environment and a deep Java EE learning requirement due to this complexity. The fact that these requirements also increase the management cost of the applications has ensured that the Spring Framework has been kept in a short time against to Java EE.
